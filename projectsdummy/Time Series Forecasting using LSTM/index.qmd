DESCRIPTION

TIME SERIES

Recurrent Neural networks Time series prediction with LSTMs

**\## What is time series data?** Collection of data points based on the time they were collected Recorded at regular time intervals\
**\## What are the applications?** Forcasting future time series value The price of something tomorrow, for eg.bitcoins Number of sales during a given season of the year Future heart faliure\
**\## Proterties time series can have?####  Stationarity:**               when the mean and the variance remain constant over time. If the mean is varying over time, then it means time                   series has got a trend. You can avoid that, by log tranformations.\
**\####     Seasonality:**                If there are variations at specific time-frame. Eliminate that using differencing               method.Differencing is a type of tranformation, that accomplishes:                Making a time series stationary                Stabilizing the mean of the time series\
**\#### Autocorrelation:**               Refers to the correlation between the currrent value with a copy from previous time.\
\
**\## Method we are using**  The two most commonly used gated RNNs are Long Short-Term Memory Networks and Gated Recurrent Unit Neural Networks..
