DESCRIPTION

Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required). Build Regression models to predict the sales w.r.t a single & multiple feature. Also evaluate the models & compare their respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.

## Stractegic Plan of Action:

### We aim to solve the problem statement by creating a plan of action, Here are some of the necessary steps:

1.Data Exploration

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3.Data Pre-processing

4.Data Manipulation

5.Feature Selection/Extraction

6.Predictive Modelling

7.Project Outcomes & Conclusion

Here are some of the key outcomes of the project:

-   The Dataset was quiet small with just 6435 samples & after preprocessing 7.5% of the datasamples were dropped.

-   Visualising the distribution of data & their relationships, helped us to get some insights on the feature-set.

-   The features had high multicollinearity, hence in Feature Extraction step, we shortlisted the appropriate features with VIF Technique.

-   Testing multiple algorithms with default hyperparamters gave us some understanding for various models performance on this specific dataset.

-   It is safe to use multiple regression algorithm performed better than other algorithms, as their scores were quiet comparable & also they're more generalisable.
