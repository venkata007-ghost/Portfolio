DESCRIPTION

The amount of the premium for a health insurance policy depends from person to person, as many factors affect the amount of the premium for a health insurance policy. Let\'s say age, a young person is very less likely to have major health problems compared to an older person. Thus, treating an older person will be expensive compared to a young one. That is why an older person is required to pay a high premium compared to a young person.

\
Just like age, many other factors affect the premium for a health insurance policy. Hope you now have understood what health insurance is and how the premium for a health insurance policy is determined. In the section below, I will take you through the task of health insurance premium prediction with machine learning using Python.\
Health Insurance Premium Prediction using PythonThe dataset that I am using for the task of health insurance premium prediction is collected from Kaggle. It contains data about:\
• Medical Charges: Total medical expense charged to the plan for the calendar year\
• Age: Insurance contractor\'s age, ranging from 18 to 64\
• Sex: Insurance contractor\'s gender, Male or Female\
• BMI (Body Mass Index) = Body Mass Index, Weight(Kg)/( Height(m)² )\
• Children: Number of children covered by the plan/ Number of dependants\
• Region: The beneficiary\'s residential area in the US. Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, Southwest\
• Smoker: Whether the insurance contractor is a smoker or not, Yes or No\
As mentioned, medical charges will be our dependent variable and the rest will be our independent variables.
